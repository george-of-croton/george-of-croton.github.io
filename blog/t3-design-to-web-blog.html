        <h5>Web Dev Wish List</h5>  
        <h2>What is repsonsive design and why is repsonsiveness important?</h2>
        <p>
          Responsive design is design that responds to a users device and outputs the content in a style suited to their devices capabilities. When a developer incorporates responsive design in to their project, they do so in order to give their users the best experience possible whether theyre looking it at on a big screen tv or peering at an iphone on the bus. 
        </p>
        <h2>What is Mobile first design  and why is it important?</h2>
        <p>
          Mobile first design is design that takes into account the capabilites of the least powerful device the site will be run on. A site designed with lots of large images and complex features may look great on desktop but is likely to provide a cumbersome experience for mobile users. By design for mobile first we limit the range of tools we have at our disposal, but ultimately create a cleaner, leaner and more enjoyable user experience.  
        </p>
        <h2>What are frameworks?</h2>
        <p>
          A framework is a preset css style sheet that streamlines the styling process considerably. A framework provides a whole range ready to use css properties that allow us to cut out time spent defining those stock standard elements like columns, and buttons and fonts. While frameworks are an incredibly powerful tool, they may not be especially helpful for learners who need to acquaint themselves with the more mundane parts of css that a framework would take care of.
         </p>
          <h2>What is a Wireframe?</h2>
         <p>
          A wireframe is a rough draft our site. It contains all the elemnts we want to include on our site and how they will be arranged. When designing for the web its beneficial to know in advance where we will be placing titles, paragprahs images etc in advance so we can lay them out in the correct order in HTML.

        <h2>My Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          My wireframe drawings didnt really end up affecting the design of my site too much. I realised the way I had designed the wireframe was sort of awkward but I ended up creating a responsive navigation that I am pretty happy with any way. It took a while to work out how to properly integrate the drop down list. For the mobile sites I just tried to strip everything down to a basic level. I realised a little too late that I should have designed for the mobile site first and built up from there.
