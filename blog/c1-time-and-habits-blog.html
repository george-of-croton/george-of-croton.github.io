          <strong>What's your take on the EDA experience?</strong><br>
          The EDA experience seems to be intense, challenging and immersive. My take away from Shareef's talk is that you will get the best out of EDA by relieving yourself of any expectation of what you might get out of the course. Instead, focus your energy on exceeding your own expectations of what you are capable of.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What are your impressions?</strong><br>
          My impressions are that EDA isn't trying to sell me a dream. I am guaranteednothing. This is a hardcore educational experience that will, if I commit and allow, lay a foundation of knowledge that I could build upon for the rest of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</strong><br>
          I see myself engaging well with this type of culture. I am a big believer in the power of cooperation and coordination. I also enjoy teaching and helping others as a way of crystalising the lessons in my brain, so the EDA mentally seems quite a good fit.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed?if so, how?</strong><br>
          <br>
          My expectations of EDA have not changed all that much since my initial interview. I always knew that It was going to be a challenge and it has certainly been that. I am enjoying the course more than I thought I would and find myself staying up late into the night tinkering around.
          </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong><br>
          EDA provides a very unique learning environment and I am really eager to be part of it. I have never struggled learning in the past although I have never felt very comfortable in the institutions I have attended. I don't know if it was because they were too traditional or too impersonal but I already feel a lot more engaged and accountable for my learning through EDA's teaching style.
