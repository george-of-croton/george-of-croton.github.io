          <h2>Week 1: Time and Habits</h2>
          <p>
            Less than a week into phase-0 of EDA I am realising just how important developing good time management and well being habits is going to be in this course.Coming into EDA I was certainly anxious about my ability to properly manage my time. It has been a problem for me in the past.<br>
            <br>
            The pomodoro techinique makes a lot of sense to me. The intervals of work and respite reminds me of how you would lift weights at the gym. You perform a set number of reps with rests in between sets. The idea being that you can perform considerably more reps in total by breaking them up into sets than if you were to just continually lift over over until you were exhausted.<br>
            <br>

            While I was mainly anxious about the time management element of the course, I was also concerned about the my health, both physical and mental. It's no secret that sitting down and staring at a computer monitor all day isn't great for you, so I can see why EDA have put an emphasis on activites like meditation and yoga. I have definitely found both of these benficial in the past and actually look forward to seeing how they can come in to play in relieving any of the stress/distress this course is sure to cause me.<br>
            <br>
            As much as I like yoga and meditation, I am defintely at my my most zen when running or cycling. Hopefully I can find some other members of my cohort who enjoy jogging and it could become some sort of moblile brain storming session.<br>
            <br>
            I will definitely dabble in a few more time management techniques over the next few weeks. So far I would say the humble Toggl button has been my favourite time management tip. Getting to see you daily total of time spent working is super satisfying. I Just need to be more vigilant with turning it on and off. This weeks data is a little... innaccurate.
