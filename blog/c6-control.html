         Motivation. We need it every day. It gets us out of bed. It makes us breakfast. It helps us achieve our goals. But as mere mortals our motivation is always under threat. Self-doubt, pessimism and a whole array other factors undermine our motivation, our desire to try. Which actually makes a lot of sense, because if we were motivated to do everything we simply would not have enough energy. Chade-Meng says, that the key to finding motivation is finding something that aligns with our values, something that we love, and believe is worth the energy and the risk.

         Chade-Meng teaches us how finding something that we love, and believe is worthwhile will give us the energy to apply ourselves, to strive for greatness and give ourselves the best opportunity to succeed. For me, this definitely rang true. I have completed a university degree almost entirely out of fear not motivation. I signed up for a university before I was even old enough to buy a bottle of beer. I was committed to something before I really knew myself. Now while I do not regret it at all and am proud of my achievement, I do realise in hindsight that I was not motivated through out my studies. Everyday was a grind, I did not love my work, I was just sort of good at it so I persevered. 

        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, my first few weeks at EDA flew by. I would sit down at my computer, and even though it was tough, the hours would fly by. I remembered how much I loved computing, and web design. I was taken back to my highschool days when I curated a blog with my friends, that we designed and coded together. We would work on it every day. It wasn't a chore, it wasn't work. We did it for fun. It was a creative outlet, it just didn't look like one. We were obsessed. So at the moment I feel grateful to be apart of EDA, it taught what it felt like to be passionate, and deeply involved in something after years of feeling isolated and detached from my work at university. 
        </p>

          Now while all this warm fuzzy stuff is great, Chade-Meng brings us back down to earth by identifying the importance of struggle in achieving anything really meaningful. He teaches us that no matter how much you love something, or how dedicated you are, you will always come up against barriers, frustration and road blocks. This is where resilience comes in. Resilience, requires mindfulness, the ability to take ourselves away from the iminent frustrations of life and allow ourselves to reasses why we are doing this. If we are mindful of the necessity of struggle then we can put the situation in to perspective and see it as another opportunity to learn and grow rather than seeing it as something that is preventing us from doing so.
