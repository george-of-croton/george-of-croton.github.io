        <h3>A Tale of Blockage</h3>
        <p>
          It was around 8pm on a saturday evening when I first realised I had become blocked on the EDA Sprint-5 Java script racer game challenge. The assignment was to design a simple racing game in the coding language javascript. The concept was deviously basic, yet try as I might I failed to pin down how I was going to make this game. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I was beginning to lose the battle with an ever strengthening sense of frustration. "how did the others do it?", I asked myself, and decided to peek at the code of the other cohort members. At first, I was terrified by what I saw. I had no idea how everyone else had come up with these crazy codes.But after a while, I managed to discern some sense from their work, and it seemed the more I read the more I understood.

          <p> I read code, I googled keywords, I poured over message boards. I wrote code. It didn't work. I changed it. It still didn't work. I console logged. I googled. Finally things started to fall into place. You hit the button and player moved. Then the second one moved as well. Then they both moved at the same time. I fixed bugs. I made bugs. By the end I had probably the stupidest game ever. A combination of intellectual property theft and down right jankiness that provides about 30 seconds of entertainment and frusturating number of popup windows. But I love it like only a mother could. 

        </p>
        <h3>Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
        <p>
          When it comes to problem solving I think I am a pretty hands on type of person. I really have no problem watching something not work over and over again. So, I would say the "trying something" technique is probably the core of my problem solving arsenal.
        <p>
          <p>
            I like the idea of the rubber ducky method. I tend to shy away from explaining my coding work to non-coder friends, but maybe I will try incorporate that a bit more to see if it illuminates any areas for me. </p>
            <p>
              I definitely console logged a lot. Just to make sure I could see what the program was doing even when nothing was visibly changing on the screen. Then Of course googling as always. I found some really tidy solutions that ended up making my code relatively neat and straightforward. </p>
              <p>
                So far I havent really been one to ask for too much help. Since I'm usually up working late there isn't really many others online. I am too impatient to wait sometimes so I will just grind away until something clicks. Sometimes sleeping on it works well too! </p>
                <p>
                  I definitely need to try pseudocde, but again I like to be hands on so I don't naturally drift towards that method. However, I have no doubt that it will be an essential skill so I will endeavour to do this more in future projects.</p>

                    <h5>map()</h5>
                      Creates a new array with the results of performing a function on the contents of an exisiting array. 
                        so like, for example 




                    <h5>.filter()</h5>
                      Creates a new array that has the filtered contents of another array. So like, for example, one array has a bunch a numbers and you use to the filter function to create a new that contains only the prime numbers from the previous array.
                    <h5>.reduce()</h5>
                    Takes a bunch of values in an array and applies a function, like a sum  that reduces them to create smaller value or a smaller number of values. So, for example you could run a reduce function on an array that provides the sum of every value in the array. THere are heaps of other things you could do with this function. But I am not the guy you want to be asking JUST YET.
