          I make no apology for taking the issue of the TPPA and its impact on New Zealand seriously, and approaching it with caution.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s been robust debate about it among the Labour caucus, as there should be with any issue likely to have a major impact on the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Labour is a party of free trade. This isn’t a product of the last couple of high profile trade ministers in Labour governments. It goes back the full 80 years since we first formed a government. We have always championed the cause of better access to markets and free trade. We are a nation heavily dependent on exporting. It’s how we produce a large chunk of our wealth and generate jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
          My own commitment to free trade goes back to my union days when I advocated strongly for the China FTA and worked with the employees of some of our biggest exporters.  The CEO of one of the largest exporters at the time angrily denounced me at a meeting with the company as a traitor for doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
         So when something comes along calling itself a free trade agreement, I take it seriously. Not uncritically, but seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          The National government has handled the negotiations of the TPPA appallingly. Seven years of total secrecy have aroused natural suspicion about its contents. The government did nothing to inform New Zealanders about the negotiations, the issues, progress – anything in fact. The 6000 pages of agreement were dumped in November last year and academics, NGOs and citizens have been left to work their way through the document and form their own conclusions.
        </p>

        Some are critical. The deal is worth less to New Zealand than the government touted. Extending copyright will add costs to libraries and universities. The cost of pharmaceuticals to New Zealand will rise.
