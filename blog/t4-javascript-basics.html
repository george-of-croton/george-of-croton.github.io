    <!--As if talking to a non-tech friend, discuss:

 How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?
 Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'
 Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals
 Explain what functions are and why they are useful-->

        <h1>Introduction to Javascript</h1>

        <h2>Javascript vs HTML and CSS?</h2>
         <p>
          HTML and CSS provide a webpage with all the neccessary visual elements like, the words, the pictures, the menus, the buttons. But often we want our website to do more than JUST provide content. Sometimes a webpage provides a service, like a calculator that helps you do your taxes, or estimates the day you will die. Javascript allows a webpage to take inputs from a user and DO something for the user.

        </p>
        <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
        <p>
         Control flow in javascript is when we make our code make a decision about what it should do under certain conditions. For example you've got a program called "Morning Routine" and this program performs the morning routine of a very normal person. 

        </p>
        <p>
          The program starts by waking up.

          Then it has two options: have a shower, or do not have a shower. Now the program must make a decision based on the VARIABLE "body odour". The program will then determine IF body odour is at a level (VALUE) that requires the shower function to run, thus returning body odor to an acceptable level. 

        </p>
        <h2>Arrays and Objects Literals</h2>
        <p>
         Objects in javascript are ways of grouping together various pieces of related information like, the name, age, adress and phone number of a person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arrays are variables that can have a variety of values. While an object  contains  a bunchof related information, like a persons address details, an array would contain a list of firstnames (in this case object names) that would allow us to access other information related to that first name(like last Name or age!.

        </p>
        <h2>Funtions</h2>
        <p>
          Functions are a block of code written to perform a particular task. we can call on a function by writing it into our code our returning it as the result of an input! For example if we had written an address book program we would have a function called "findContact". The user would enter in a name (VARIABLE) and the function "findContact" would a series of tasks that compare the name entered with name stored in a database in the code until it either finds the appropriate contact and returns the address or ELSE it returns something like "contact not found!"
