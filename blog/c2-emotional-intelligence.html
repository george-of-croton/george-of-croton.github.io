          The most important thing I took from Meng's chapter on mindfulness was that I can always be improving myself through his techniques. Meng explains that every time we lose concentration we have an opportunity to be mindful of our loss of concentration and refocus ourselves on the task. Weng compared this to the resistance of lifing a weight at the gym. The resistance in this case is not provided by gravity but is provided by our minds natural tendency for distraction. We acknowledge our distraction and resist further distraction and next thing you know you have performed a mental pull up or dead lift or whatever works for you.

          As a runner I find meditation particularly appealing as they both share an element of endurance. I think what draws me to running is that in a world of frustration and complicated decisions I can find order in sense in the straight forward nature of running. To get better at running I don't have to learn a new method, or formula or code each time I put my shoes on. If I just get out there and run and persist at it I will improve. The same seems to be go for meditation. You must simply fight your lizard brains urge to stop.

          I found the 2 minutes of mindfulness to be a little brief. I hope over time and with practice I will be able to achieve more with that two minutes. Seems like a really effective way to preempt stress and keep yourself productive.
