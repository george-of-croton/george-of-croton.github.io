        <h2>Mindfulnesss in Daily life</h2>
         <p>
          As mere humans, we are subject to all sorts of crazy stuff, boring stuff, or scary stuff on any given day. And all this stuff evokes emotions, be they big or small. By practicing mindfulness habitually we can learn how our bodies respond to different situations. For example, just the other day I was at my computer and I was really stuck on a javascript exercise. I don't want to think how long I had spent on it and I was getting reall frustrated. I stepped away from my laptop and tried to clear my head. I though about trying a few mindfulness techniques. The first thing i noticed was that my heart was beating really fast. So i decided to try to some mindful breathing for a few minutes and i managed to slow my heart rate down and get in to a different head space.
          </p>
          <p>

           What I learned from that experience was that I had clearly become frustrated to the point that my emotions were getting in the way of my ability to think clearly. So in the future I know to check myself for signals of overwhelming frustration and to  take myself our of the situation to clear my head and try again
