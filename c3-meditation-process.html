  () - Parentheses

Parentheses are used to store paramaters in javascript. Paramaters represent the information that will be passed to a function when it is invoked. so you might have a piece of code like "var multiply = function(x, y){}". When we invoke the function we will replace the x, y parameters with the numbers we want multiplied. When we write the function the stuff inside the brackets are called "parameters". When we invoke the function they are called "arguments"

[] - Square Brackets

Square brackets are used create arrays! arrays are lists in javascript that hold all types of data and indexes each bit of data so we can easily access it.

Say you have an array called "shoes" that looks like this var shoes = ["nike", "adidas, "puma", "asics", "reebok", "new balance" ]. The array neatly stores all our shoes and assigns each a number or "index". So if we wanted to log "puma" to console we could do it like this "console.log(shoes[2])". Here we have accessed the item at index 2 in the array "shoes". Javascript arrays use zero based indexing. This means that each array starts (our start point is nike) at 0. so if wanted to log "nike" to the console we would do it like this "console.log(shoes[0]".

{} - Curly Braces

Curly braces are used for two things. First, they are used for containing the code that will be run when a function is invoked. so say we had a function called "helloSayer" and we simply wanted it to alert "Hello" we would include the code for the alert inside curly braces like this "helloSayer(){ alert("Hello");}".

We can also use curly braces to build objects. Objects in javascript are like code representations of real life things. Like say we had an object called George (that's me). Inside that object "George" we could define a bunch of things about George like his age, his height, his eye color. ANYTHING WE WANTED. Basically, an object is an awesome way of organising related information and we do so by including this information inside curly braces!

"", '' - Double quotes and single quotes

Quotation marks are used to making strings in javascript. Strings are just characters contained within quotation marks. "I like to eat apples" is a string. "I am 2000 years old" is a string. Sometimes we want to include quotation marks inside a string so we do it by using one kind of quotation mark on the outisde and another on the inside like this "See how I used double Quotation marks 'and single quotation marks'. On our webpage we would only see the single quotation marks displatey because the double quotation marks are defining this information as a string".
